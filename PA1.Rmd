```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
grDate <- group_by(tblA, date)
stepsByDay <- summarise(grDate, mean(steps))
#hist(stepsByDay)
hist(stepsByDay$mean)
#aggregate(cbind(steps) ~ date, data=activity, FUN=mean)

```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
